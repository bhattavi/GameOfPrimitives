# GameOfPrimitives

Project: Game of Primitives

Your first project is to create a ​simplified​ version of the classic game “Duck Hunt” but with primitive shapes instead of ducks. You have 3 rounds to click on the moving shapes to get points.

What are the requirements for the project?

The following are ​required​ to earn points for the project: 

Menu Scene (5%)

- Title of the game, your name, Pace email and press space to start.

Game Scene (70%)

- There needs to be 2 different primitives (such as a square and circle) that move around in different ways (one harder to get than the other) such as different directions, randomly, faster, etc.
- Clicking on one should give you a point (and remove it), the harder one should give more points.
- You move to the next round after both have been clicked or the player has clicked 5 times.

3 Rounds (20%)

- There should be 3 rounds. The UI should indicate which round it is, such as “Round 1” (Hint: You can duplicate a scene as well as hide/show objects.)

Game Over Scene (5%)

- Show the words “Game Over” and the final score and press space to return to main menu.
